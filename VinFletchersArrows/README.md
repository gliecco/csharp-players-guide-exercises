# Vin Fletcher's Arrows

In this challenge, the task was to write a program that enables a user to customize and calculate the cost of arrows by selecting the type of arrowhead, fletching material, and the arrow's length. The objective was to create an Arrow class with fields for arrowhead type, fletching type, and length, using enumerations for arrowhead and fletching types, so users can select these attributes to instantiate a new Arrow object. A GetCost method was implemented to compute and return the arrow's total cost and display it to the user.
