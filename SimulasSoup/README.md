# Simula's Soup

In this challenge, the task was to write a program that allows a user to choose a recipe type (soup, stew, or gumbo), a main ingredient (mushroom, chicken, carrots, or potatoes), and a seasoning (spicy, salty, or sweet) to create a custom dish. The user inputs their choices, and the program displays the final dish in a formatted output. The goal was to use enums and tuples for structured data representation and practice user input handling.
